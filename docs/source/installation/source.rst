**Building and Installing**

Use the terminal/Prompt to navigate into the directory containing the
package (usually, the folder is named nmrcryspy),

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd nmrcryspy

From within the source code folder, type the following in the terminal to install the
library.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install .

If you get an error that you don't have the permission to install the package into
the default ``site-packages`` directory, you may try installing with the ``--user``
options as,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install . --user
